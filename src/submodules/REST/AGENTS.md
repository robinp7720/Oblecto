# Agent Instructions: REST Module

When making any changes to the REST API (routes, controllers, or middleware), you MUST update the central API documentation in `docs/API.md` to reflect these changes. 

Ensure that:
1. New endpoints are added with their respective methods, parameters, and response formats.
2. Modified endpoints are updated to match the new behavior.
3. Removed endpoints are deleted from the documentation.
4. Any changes to authentication or global middleware are updated in the relevant sections.
